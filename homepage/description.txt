==main.js==


Description:

The `main.js` file is a JavaScript script designed to enhance the functionality and interactivity of a website. It serves as the main driver for various dynamic features and user interactions. Here's a breakdown of its key functionalities:

1. **Selector Helper Function:**
   - The script provides an easy-to-use selector helper function (`select`) for selecting DOM elements. It supports selecting a single element or multiple elements.

2. **Event Listener Function:**
   - An event listener function (`on`) simplifies the process of attaching event listeners to elements. It can be used to listen for various events on a single or multiple elements.

3. **Scroll Event Listener:**
   - The script includes a function (`onscroll`) specifically for handling scroll events. This is utilized for implementing dynamic behavior based on the user's scroll actions.

4. **Navbar Links Active State:**
   - The script dynamically manages the active state of navigation bar links based on the user's scroll position. It ensures that the corresponding section is highlighted when it comes into view.

5. **Smooth Scrolling:**
   - The `scrollto` function enables smooth scrolling to a specified element, considering the header offset. The header's appearance is adjusted based on whether the page has been scrolled.

6. **Header Scrolled Class Toggle:**
   - The script toggles a CSS class (`header-scrolled`) on the header element to modify its styling when the user scrolls down the page.

7. **Back-to-Top Button:**
   - A back-to-top button appears dynamically as the user scrolls down and disappears when near the top. This feature enhances user experience by allowing them to easily return to the top of the page.

8. **Mobile Navigation Toggle:**
   - The script provides functionality for toggling a mobile navigation menu. It changes the appearance of a toggle button and the mobile navigation menu itself.

9. **Mobile Navigation Dropdowns:**
   - Dropdowns in the navigation menu are activated on click, specifically tailored for mobile navigation.

10. **Scroll-to Links:**
    - Links with the class `scrollto` scroll to the corresponding section on the page when clicked. The script also handles adjustments for mobile navigation.

11. **Intro Type Effect:**
    - The script utilizes the Typed.js library to create a dynamic typing effect for an element with the class `typed`. It displays a sequence of strings with customizable speed and looping options.

12. **Portfolio Lightbox:**
    - The script initializes a portfolio lightbox using the GLightbox library, allowing users to view portfolio items in an interactive lightbox.

13. **Preloader:**
    - The script includes a preloader that is removed when the window has fully loaded, ensuring a smooth transition from the loading state to the actual content.


In summary, `main.js` significantly contributes to a seamless and engaging user experience on the website by incorporating features such as smooth scrolling, dynamic navigation, animated typing effects, and interactive lightboxes for portfolio items.
