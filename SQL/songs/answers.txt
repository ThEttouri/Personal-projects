If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
We can characterize their audio aura by calculating the average energy, valence, and danceability of these songs. These metrics will provide insights into the listener's overall mood preferences, energy levels, and danceability preferences based on their top songs from that specific year.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
The way we calculated the audio aura by averaging energy, valence, and danceability might not be very representative of the listener because it relies solely on numerical averages and does not take into account the listener's individual tastes and preferences. Different listeners may have diverse music preferences, and using a simple average may not capture the complexity and nuances of their music choices.
A better way to calculate the audio aura would be to use machine learning algorithms or advanced data analysis techniques. By incorporating more features from the songs and considering the listener's historical music preferences, we could create a more personalized and accurate audio aura for the listener. This approach would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the listener's music taste and emotional response to the songs.
