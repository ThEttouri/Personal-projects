**Login Page Design:**

The login page is a thoughtfully crafted interface designed for user authentication. Its aesthetic and functional elements prioritize user experience while maintaining a visually appealing layout.

**HTML Structure:**
- The HTML document follows best practices with a proper doctype declaration (`<!DOCTYPE html>`) and sets the language to English (`<html lang="en">`).
- Meta tags (`charset` and `viewport`) are included for character set declaration and responsive design considerations.

**Styling:**
- The page employs a clean and modern design, utilizing the popular Arial font and a sans-serif fallback for readability across different platforms.
- The use of flexbox ensures a centered display both horizontally and vertically, contributing to a balanced visual presentation.
- The background color (`#f0f0f0`) provides a subtle contrast to the login container, enhancing visibility and focus.

**Login Container:**
- The login container is styled with a white background (`#fff`), a subtle border (`#ccc`), and a slight box shadow, creating a card-like appearance.
- Adequate padding and border-radius enhance the overall visual appeal and user comfort.

**Input Fields:**
- Username and password input fields are provided with consistent styling, including border, padding, and border-radius for a cohesive look.
- The "Remember me" checkbox is aligned with its label, contributing to a neat and organized form structure.

**Submit Button:**
- The "Login" button features a vibrant green color (`#4CAF50`) for a call-to-action effect, while the white text ensures high contrast and readability.
- A subtle hover effect (`#45a049`) is applied, enhancing the interactive feel of the button.

**Forgot Password Link:**
- A conveniently placed link ("Forgot your password?") provides users with an option for password recovery.
- The link's font size is adjusted for readability without overpowering the main content.

**Scripting:**
- The page includes a simple JavaScript script for handling the login functionality.
- Upon clicking the "Login" button, the script retrieves values from the username and password fields, triggering an alert for successful or unsuccessful login attempts.
