=== Spell-Checker Implementation ===

This C program serves as a spell-checker, designed to check the spelling of words in a given text file against a provided dictionary. Below is an overview of the key components:

1. **File Structure:**
   - The code comprises three main files: `speller.c`, `dictionary.c`, and `dictionary.h`.
   - The dictionary is loaded into memory using a hash table for efficient word lookup.

2. **Main Functionality:**
   - The program checks the spelling of words in a text file, reporting any misspelled words.
   - Benchmarking is incorporated to measure the time spent on loading the dictionary, checking spellings, determining the dictionary's size, and unloading the dictionary.

3. **Case-Insensitive Check:**
   - The spell-checking function is designed to be case-insensitive, ensuring accurate results regardless of word capitalization.

4. **Hash Function:**
   - The code features a hash function in `dictionary.c` to efficiently distribute words across the hash table.
   - The choice of hash function impacts the overall performance of the spell-checker.

5. **Memory Management:**
   - The code handles memory allocation and deallocation to prevent memory leaks.
   - The dictionary can be efficiently loaded into memory and later unloaded when spell-checking is complete.

6. **Usage:**
   - The program is executed using the command `./speller [dictionary] text`, with optional paths for the dictionary and text files.

7. **Performance Metrics:**
   - The program provides valuable metrics, including misspelled words, words in the dictionary, words in the text, and time benchmarks for various operations.

8. **Customization Opportunities:**
   - The implementation allows for customization of the hash function for optimal performance.
   - The structure of the dictionary file can be modified, adhering to certain format assumptions.

9. **Clean and Readable Code:**
   - The code is organized and documented for clarity, ensuring readability and ease of understanding.

10. **Instructions for Reviewers:**
    - Reviewers are encouraged to explore the codebase, paying attention to the structure, logic, and any customizations made to enhance spell-checking efficiency.

Feel free to delve into the code and explore the intricacies of the spell-checker implementation. For a more in-depth understanding, refer to the source files `speller.c`, `dictionary.c`, and `dictionary.h`.

Thank you for taking the time to review this spell-checker implementation.
