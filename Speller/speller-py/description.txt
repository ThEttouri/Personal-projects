=== Spell-Checker Implementation (Python) ===

This Python implementation consists of two files: `speller.py` and `dictionary.py`, along with a file structure containing dictionaries and text files. Below is an overview of the key components:

#### `dictionary.py`
- **Functionality:**
  - `check(word)`: Checks if a given word is in the loaded dictionary (case-insensitive).
  - `load(dictionary)`: Loads a specified dictionary file into memory.
  - `size()`: Returns the size of the loaded dictionary.
  - `unload()`: Unloads the dictionary from memory.

- **Implementation:**
  - The script maintains a set called `words` to store dictionary words.
  - Words are loaded from a specified dictionary file into the set.
  - The size of the loaded dictionary is tracked.

#### `speller.py`
- **Functionality:**
  - Loads a dictionary, spell-checks a given text file, and reports misspelled words.
  - Measures the time taken for loading, spell-checking, determining dictionary size, and unloading.

- **Usage:**
  - Execute the script using the command: `python speller.py [dictionary] text`.

- **File Structure:**
  - Three folders containing dictionaries, keys, and texts.

- **Spell-Checking Logic:**
  - Reads characters from a text file, identifying words for spell-checking.
  - Checks each word against the loaded dictionary.
  - Reports misspelled words and calculates various benchmarks.

- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Reports the number of misspelled words, words in the dictionary, words in the text, and time benchmarks for each operation.

- **Clean and Readable Code:**
  - The code is well-organized, with meaningful variable names and comments.

#### **Instructions for Reviewers:**
- Review the `dictionary.py` file to understand the implementation of dictionary-related functions.
- Explore the `speller.py` file to understand the overall spell-checking process and benchmarking.
- Examine the file structure to identify the organization of dictionaries, keys, and text files.
- Evaluate the script's overall readability, structure, and adherence to good coding practices.
