=== Credit Card Validator Implementation (Python) ===

This Python program validates credit card numbers using Luhn's Algorithm. Below is an overview of the key components and implementation details:

#### Implementation Details:
- The program prompts the user for a credit card number, ensuring it is a positive integer.
- It uses Luhn's Algorithm to validate whether the credit card number is syntactically valid.
- The program categorizes the valid credit card numbers into American Express, MasterCard, or Visa.

#### Functions:
1. **`checksum(number)`**
   - Calculates the checksum of a credit card number based on Luhn's Algorithm.
   - Returns `True` if the checksum is valid; otherwise, returns `False`.

2. **`print_credit_card_brand(number)`**
   - Prints the brand of the credit card based on its starting digits.

#### Main Execution:
- The `main` function prompts the user for a credit card number and then calls the `checksum` function to determine its validity.
- If the number is valid, it calls `print_credit_card_brand` to print the brand of the credit card; otherwise, it prints "INVALID".
