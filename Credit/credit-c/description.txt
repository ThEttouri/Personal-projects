=== Credit Card Validator Implementation (C) ===

This C program, implemented in the file `credit.c`, is designed to validate credit card numbers using Luhn's Algorithm. Below is an overview of the key components and implementation details:

#### Implementation Details:
- The program prompts the user for a credit card number, ensuring it is entirely numeric and devoid of hyphens.
- It uses Luhn's Algorithm to validate whether the credit card number is syntactically valid.
- The program categorizes the valid credit card numbers into American Express, MasterCard, or Visa.

#### Functions:
1. **`check_validity(long ccn)`**
   - Determines the validity of a credit card number using Luhn's Algorithm.
   - Returns `true` if the number is valid; otherwise, returns `false`.

2. **`find_length(long ccn)`**
   - Finds the length of a credit card number.
   - Used to identify the type of credit card (American Express, MasterCard, or Visa).

3. **`checksum(long ccn)`**
   - Calculates the checksum of a credit card number based on Luhn's Algorithm.
   - Returns `true` if the checksum is valid; otherwise, returns `false`.

4. **`print_credit_card_brand(long ccn)`**
   - Prints the brand of the credit card based on its starting digits.
